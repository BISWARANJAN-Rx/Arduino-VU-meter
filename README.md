# Arduino-VU-meter
This code is for VU meter made by Arduino. Making it so simple and budget friendly. This code also have auto Scaling (auto Sensitivity) which is use full for poor(low amplitude) signal. If your signal pick voltage is more than 5V then you have to stepdown to 5V through resister divider circuit or a simple potentiometer. Also u have to use some protection circuit like zener diode or some other circuit for accidentally over voltage and speaker coil discharge.
